# Advent-of-go 2019

Bit late to the party attacking the 2019 advent of code challenges but here we go (no pun intended). Will try to tackle each of the challenges using go.

Starting from no real foundation so please do not see these solutions as anything other than someone learning as they go (did it again!).
